# Data-Analysis

This repository showcases my journey into the world of data analysis. As a professional at Ericsson (since March 2024), I'm passionate about uncovering insights from data and aspiring to a career in this field. This repository contains projects demonstrating proficiency in:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python with Pandas and other relevant libraries.
Data visualization and dashboard creation using Power BI.
SQL for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) and data exploration and reporting.
Projects will cover various data analysis techniques and aim to provide practical examples of real-world data challenges.
